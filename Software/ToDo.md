#To Do

## Keyboard Commands

* Allow for tracking to be "paused" and "resumed" via keyboard (p)

* Allow for the current face to be selected via keyboard input (space for jump :P ). So, if it is currently tracking the most centered face, a spacebar press will make it jump to tracking the second face until the second face is lost and then it will track the first face

## Facial Persistance

* When given 2+ faces do not just blindly use the first face, use whatever face is closest to the last first face. Hopefully this will mitigate the persistance problem
